# Product Base
This is a prototype of a payment system that allows
the customer to have a balance and use it to pay for orders. Orders, in turn, consist of items that can be both weighty and quantitative. The cost of goods per unit of weight or quantity is stored in the database. To develop this program, UML diagrams describing it from different angles are presented below.
